# Advent of Code
This repository contains all of my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
Each year is in its own branch. The first AoC I did was 2024.
Currently all solutions written in Haskell (cool language!).

This repository used to just be for 2024, but I decided to move each year
to its own branch in a single repo so I don't spam my repositories with
AoC.
